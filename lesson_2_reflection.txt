How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    command > diff -u file1 file2
    detects lines where diffs are. line are tagged with + / - signs to explain
    wheter it's an addition to the file or a deletion. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    one can see changes and detect sources of errors more easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    because there are connections between files and they need to be taken 
    into account to ease analysis

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    when coding you might need to change several files to materialize a new 
    feature. Thus, one need to be able to view the changes as a block. in other systems, you only deal with one file at a time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    command > git log
    provides the history of changes made in the repository
    command > git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2
    highlights the differences between the 2 commits. commit_id_1 should be the
    oldest one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    now i can make big changes while having an assurance :)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    all my projects

LESSON 2

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    it create the git workspace. otherwise no repo !

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    it allows to create the block of files that will be commited
